# Mental-Health-Monitoring-and-Support-System

This project combines a Chatbot for Mental Health Support with a Visual Monitoring System that detects if an individual is experiencing pain. The system provides timely support and helps monitor mental well-being using state-of-the-art AI techniques.

#Inspiration
The project was inspired by the global mental health crisis and the lack of accessible, timely support. Many people struggle with mental health issues but do not seek help due to stigma or lack of resources. We wanted to create a solution that could engage individuals in meaningful conversations about their mental well-being while also detecting physical signs of distress. Our goal was to build a comprehensive system that addresses both mental and physical health, providing early intervention and support, empowering individuals to manage their mental health more effectively.

#What it does
The Mental Health Monitoring and Support System is an AI-powered tool that:

Chatbot: Engages users in conversations about their mental health, offering empathetic responses and support based on their inputs.
Visual Monitoring System: Uses image recognition to detect if a person is in distress or experiencing pain based on facial expressions or body language. The goal is to provide real-time support and guidance to individuals who may not otherwise seek help.

#How we built it
The Chatbot was built using Hugging Face’s implementation of OpenAI’s GPT-2 model. We fine-tuned the model with a mental health dataset from CounselChat to ensure it could handle sensitive conversations effectively.
The Visual Monitoring System was developed using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model, which we fine-tuned on a custom dataset of images showing signs of physical discomfort. The system is designed to detect visual cues that indicate the user may need support.
The project was developed using Python, with libraries like TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, and OpenCV for image processing.

#Challenges we ran into
Data availability: Mental health datasets are often limited, and we had to work hard to find relevant data for fine-tuning our chatbot and visual system.
Model fine-tuning: Ensuring that both the chatbot and the Vision Transformer models were sensitive and accurate was difficult. It took multiple iterations to improve the chatbot's empathy and the monitoring system’s accuracy in detecting distress.
Real-time monitoring: Creating a system that could provide immediate responses to visual inputs was a technical challenge. We had to optimize our code to ensure the system was responsive without sacrificing accuracy.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully integrating a mental health chatbot and a visual monitoring system to create a comprehensive support tool.
Fine-tuning AI models to handle sensitive mental health topics and detecting physical signs of pain in a real-time setting.
Building a project that could make a real difference in addressing the growing mental health crisis by offering timely and accessible support.

#What we learned
We gained a deeper understanding of:

AI in healthcare: How to use AI to address real-world issues, especially in sensitive areas like mental health.
Transfer learning: How pre-trained models can be adapted for specific use cases with minimal data.
Model optimization: The complexities of optimizing models for real-time applications. Additionally, we learned the importance of handling sensitive topics with care when building technology that interacts with vulnerable individuals.

#What's next for Mental Health Monitoring and Support System
Moving forward, we aim to:

Expand the dataset: Incorporate more diverse data to improve the chatbot’s conversational range and the visual system’s accuracy in detecting different levels of distress.
Real-world testing: Deploy the system in real-life scenarios to see how it performs and gather feedback for improvement.
Enhance support options: Integrate more features like connecting users to professional mental health resources or helplines based on their conversations or visual cues.
Mobile app: Build a mobile application to make the system more accessible and provide support on the go.
